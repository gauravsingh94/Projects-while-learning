# Projects-while-learning

This repository contains all the projects that I have worked on while learning from the "Open-source-cohort" course by Harkarit Singh.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my progress and development as I learn various concepts and technologies throughout the course. Each project represents a milestone in my learning journey and demonstrates my understanding of the topics covered in the course.
